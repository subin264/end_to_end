Interserve had suffered a cyber attack in which the attackers sent a phishing mail to the mailbox of Interserve's accounting team. The mail was opened by an employee who also downloaded and opened an attached zip file. This allowed the attackers to install malware and siphon off personal data from 113,000 employees. The siphoned data contained bank account information, social security numbers, ethnicity, sexual orientation and religion of the data subjects, among other things. 

The DPA's investigation found that inadequate security measures allowed the attack to occur. 

Interservere employees, for example, had not been adequately trained on data privacy. 

In addition, Interserve processed personal data on unsupported operating systems that were no longer subject to security updates to address vulnerabilities in the system. Also, Interserve had not conducted adequate vulnerability scans. Finally, Interserve's information security team had not sufficiently investigated the attack as antivirus software reported that the malware had been removed.",https://etid.link/ETid-1461; https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/mpns/4021951/interserve-group-limited-monetary-penalty-notice.pdf; https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1461

Easylife is a retailer that sells household items as well as services and products under its health, motor, supercard and garden clubs.

When purchasing certain products, the company made assumptions about the customer's health condition, whereupon the customer was then offered further products for purchase by phone or SMS that were related to their health condition. 

Of the 122 products in Easylife's Health Club catalog, 80 items were classified as 'trigger products.' Once customers purchased these products, Easlylife created a profile of them in order to target them with a health-related item. 

During its investigation, the DPA found that the company collected and used the personal data (health data) of a total of 145,500 data subjects without their consent or even knowledge. 

The DPA found that this 'invisible' processing of the personal data constituted a serious violation of the data subjects' rights, as they were not able to exercise their privacy and data protection rights at all due to lack of knowledge of the processing. 

In addition, the company had made 1,345,732 unsolicited marketing calls to individuals without their consent to the calls.

The Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust is a mental health specialist trust located in London.

In early September 2019, the trust wanted to run a contest asking patients at the adult gender identity clinic to provide artwork to decorate a renovated clinic building. For this, two emails were inadvertently sent with an open distribution list (one to 912 recipients and the second to 869 recipients).

It was clear from the content of the email that all recipients were patients of the clinic. The trust immediately recognized the error and unsuccessfully attempted to recall the emails. 

As part of its investigation, the IOC determined that the trust had no technical or organizational measures in place to prevent or mitigate this highly predictable human error. The ICO rated the harm to affected individuals as high given that information about the affected individuals' relationship with a gender identity clinic is very sensitive personal information. 


Due to immediate implementation of security measures and extensive cooperation with the ICO, the fine was reduced from EUR 910,000 to EUR 91,00.",https://etid.link/ETid-1250; https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/mpns/4020812/the-tavistock-portman-nhs-foundation-trust-mpn.pdf; https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1250

Individuals' profiles can be enriched with information associated with those images, such as image tags and geolocation. Clearview AI no longer offers its services in the UK, but it does in other countries, which means that the company continues to use personal data of UK residents. 

In the course of its investigation the DPA found that the personal data contained in the company's database had been processed unlawfully and without a valid legal basis. 

Furthermore, in order to exercise their rights under the GDPR, such as the right of access under Art. 15 GDPR, data subjects had to provide Clearview with additional personal data by submitting a photograph of themselves that could be matched against the Clearview database. According to the DPA, this constitutes a significant impediment and deterrent to the exercise of such rights.

In addition, the DPA found that the company had violated several principles of the GDPR. For example, the company had violated the principle of transparency by failing to adequately inform users about the processing of their data. Clearview had also violated violated the principle of storage limitation by not providing a data retention policy and thus not being able to ensure that personal data is not held for longer than necessary.

The disclosed personal data was available online for two hours and 21 minutes and had been accessed 3,872 times.

During the investigation, the ICO found that the group was created with insufficiently secure settings, resulting in approximately 780 pages of confidential emails being viewable online for nearly three years.  This resulted in personal information, such as names and email addresses, of 550 people being online.

A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.

It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.

--> Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of £ 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.",https://etid.link/ETid-60; https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/mpns/2618524/marriott-international-inc-mpn-20201030.pdf; https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-60

This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.

In the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at £20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000).
