In imposing the fine, the DPA took into account, as an aggravating factor, the extraordinary depth of the violation of the fundamental right to data protection.

The company stated that the purpose of the installed video cameras was to prevent and investigate criminal acts and to track the movement of goods in the warehouses. However, to prevent theft, a company must first consider milder methods. Moreover, video surveillance to detect criminal acts is only permitted if there is a reasonable suspicion against specific persons. If this is the case, it may be permissible to monitor them with cameras for a limited period of time. At notebooksbilliger.de, however, the video surveillance was neither limited to a specific period nor to specific employees.

A caller could obtain extensive information on personal customer data from the company's customer service department simply by entering a customer's name and date of birth. In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low.

According to the data protection authority, personal data of tenants were stored without checking whether storage was permissible or even necessary and it was therefore possible to access personal data of affected tenants which had been stored for years without this data still serving the purpose of its original collection. This involved data on the personal and financial circumstances of tenants, such as salary statements, self-disclosure forms, extracts from employment and training contracts, tax, social security and health insurance data as well as bank statements. In addition to sanctioning this structural violation, the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases. See the separate entry. *** UPDATE *** On 24 February 2021 the Berlin Regional Court has dismissed the fine against Deutsche Wohnen SE due to procedural errors, see link and link. This was based on the fact that, according to German law, a fine can only be issued to a company if the offence is attributable to a natural person, such as a managing director or employee. The case was then appealed to the Appellate Court of Berlin, which on 16 December 2022 in turn referred it to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary decision on whether the Regional Court's decision aligned with European law. On 5 December 2023 the European Court of Justice ruled that while culpability is indeed required for a fine to be issued, it is not always necessary to attribute the offence to a natural person. If the controller is a company instead of a natural person, it shall suffice if the offence is attributable to the company itself. In light of this decision the Appellate Court of Berlin overturned the initial decision of the Regional Court of Berlin and referred the case back to the Regional Court of Berlin for a new decision which, at the time of the editorial deadline of this update, is still pending, see link | https://rsw.beck.de/aktuell/daily/meldung/detail/kg-streit-um-millionen-bussgeld-gegen-deutsche-wohnen#:~:text=Die%20Beh%C3%B6rde%20wirft%20der%20Deutsche,von%2014%2C5%20Millionen%20Euro.",https://etid.link/ETid-98; https://www.datenschutz-berlin.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/pressemitteilungen/2019/20191105-PM-Bussgeld_DW.pdf; https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-98
