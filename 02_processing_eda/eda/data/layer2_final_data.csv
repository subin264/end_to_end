The information charged McKinsey U.S. with one felony count of knowingly destroying records, documents and tangible objects with the intent to impede, obstruct, and influence the investigation and proper administration of a matter within the jurisdiction of the Justice Department; and one misdemeanor count of knowingly and intentionally conspiring with Purdue and others to aid and abet the misbranding of prescription drugs, held for sale after shipment in interstate commerce, without valid prescriptions. McKinsey agreed to pay a penalty of over $231 million, a forfeiture amount of over $93 million (reflecting all money it was paid by Purdue from 2004 to 2019) and a payment of $2 million to the Virginia Medicaid Fraud Control Unit to resolve the criminal allegations. McKinsey also has entered into a civil settlement agreement in which it will pay over $323 million to resolve its liability under the False Claims Act for allegedly providing advice to Purdue Pharma L.P. that caused the submission of false and fraudulent claims to federal healthcare programs for medically unnecessary prescriptions of OxyContin, as well as allegedly failing to disclose to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) conflicts of interest arising from McKinsey's concurrent work for Purdue and the FDA.",Link to this record on U.S. Violation Tracker: here,us,1_us_cases.csv,,,

The judgment required the company to pay $16.1 million in damages and $36.8 million in civil penalties, plus post-judgment interest and costs. Following a four-week bench trial in February and March 2022, the trial court found Symantec liable for making knowing false claims to the United States when it mispresented its commercial sales practices during the negotiation and subsequent performance of a General Services Administration (GSA) contract. In particular, the court concluded that Symantec made false statements to GSA during contractual negotiations in 2006 and early-2007 and continued to falsely certify throughout the performance of the contract through Sept. 30, 2012, that its disclosures of its commercial sales practices were current, accurate and complete. The false disclosures induced GSA to accept and then continue to pay higher prices than it would have had it known of Symantec's actual commercial pricing practices. Gen Digital's payment ended a lawsuit filed under the qui tam or whistleblower provision of the False Claims Act, which permits private parties to file suit on behalf of the United States for false claims and share in a portion of the government's recovery. The Act permits the United States to intervene and take over responsibility for litigating these cases, as the United States did here. The qui tam case is captioned United States ex rel. Morsell v. Symantec Corp., Civ. A.

The siphoned data contained bank account information, social security numbers, ethnicity, sexual orientation and religion of the data subjects, among other things. 

The DPA's investigation found that inadequate security measures allowed the attack to occur. 

Interservere employees, for example, had not been adequately trained on data privacy. 

In addition, Interserve processed personal data on unsupported operating systems that were no longer subject to security updates to address vulnerabilities in the system.

Of the 122 products in Easylife's Health Club catalog, 80 items were classified as 'trigger products.' Once customers purchased these products, Easlylife created a profile of them in order to target them with a health-related item. 

During its investigation, the DPA found that the company collected and used the personal data (health data) of a total of 145,500 data subjects without their consent or even knowledge. 

The DPA found that this 'invisible' processing of the personal data constituted a serious violation of the data subjects' rights, as they were not able to exercise their privacy and data protection rights at all due to lack of knowledge of the processing.

It was clear from the content of the email that all recipients were patients of the clinic. The trust immediately recognized the error and unsuccessfully attempted to recall the emails. 

As part of its investigation, the IOC determined that the trust had no technical or organizational measures in place to prevent or mitigate this highly predictable human error. The ICO rated the harm to affected individuals as high given that information about the affected individuals' relationship with a gender identity clinic is very sensitive personal information.

Furthermore, in order to exercise their rights under the GDPR, such as the right of access under Art. 15 GDPR, data subjects had to provide Clearview with additional personal data by submitting a photograph of themselves that could be matched against the Clearview database. According to the DPA, this constitutes a significant impediment and deterrent to the exercise of such rights.

In addition, the DPA found that the company had violated several principles of the GDPR. For example, the company had violated the principle of transparency by failing to adequately inform users about the processing of their data. Clearview had also violated violated the principle of storage limitation by not providing a data retention policy and thus not being able to ensure that personal data is not held for longer than necessary.

A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.

It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.

--> Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of £ 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.",https://etid.link/ETid-60; https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/mpns/2618524/marriott-international-inc-mpn-20201030.pdf; https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-60,uk,2_uk_cases.csv,,,

This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.

In the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at £20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000).

In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data.

The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low.

According to the data protection authority, personal data of tenants were stored without checking whether storage was permissible or even necessary and it was therefore possible to access personal data of affected tenants which had been stored for years without this data still serving the purpose of its original collection. This involved data on the personal and financial circumstances of tenants, such as salary statements, self-disclosure forms, extracts from employment and training contracts, tax, social security and health insurance data as well as bank statements. In addition to sanctioning this structural violation, the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases. See the separate entry. *** UPDATE *** On 24 February 2021 the Berlin Regional Court has dismissed the fine against Deutsche Wohnen SE due to procedural errors, see link and link. This was based on the fact that, according to German law, a fine can only be issued to a company if the offence is attributable to a natural person, such as a managing director or employee. The case was then appealed to the Appellate Court of Berlin, which on 16 December 2022 in turn referred it to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary decision on whether the Regional Court's decision aligned with European law. On 5 December 2023 the European Court of Justice ruled that while culpability is indeed required for a fine to be issued, it is not always necessary to attribute the offence to a natural person. If the controller is a company instead of a natural person, it shall suffice if the offence is attributable to the company itself. In light of this decision the Appellate Court of Berlin overturned the initial decision of the Regional Court of Berlin and referred the case back to the Regional Court of Berlin for a new decision which, at the time of the editorial deadline of this update, is still pending, see link | https://rsw.beck.de/aktuell/daily/meldung/detail/kg-streit-um-millionen-bussgeld-gegen-deutsche-wohnen#:~:text=Die%20Beh%C3%B6rde%20wirft%20der%20Deutsche,von%2014%2C5%20Millionen%20Euro.",https://etid.link/ETid-98; https://www.datenschutz-berlin.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/pressemitteilungen/2019/20191105-PM-Bussgeld_DW.pdf; https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-98,de,3_de_cases.csv,,,

The pipe spun and struck the worker, causing fatal injuries. WorkSafeBC's investigation found the prime contractor had failed to ensure that piping systems were restrained and secured from inadvertent movement. In addition, the firm failed to ensure that piping operations involving pressure greater than 2,000 kPa (300 psi) were conducted by remote control. These were high-risk violations.

VTG24-68969,CA,B C Hydro & Power Authority,utilities and power generation,labor,workplace safety or health violation,2013-06-26,92840.0,WorkSafe British Columbia,"The penalty relates to four incidents between 2006 and 2010 in which the firm's workers were seriously or fatally injured. February 20, 2006: The firm sent a four-person crew to replace an old utility pole. The circuit remained energized during the replacement. One worker was electrocuted and killed when two energized power lines touched his back. WorkSafeBC's investigation found that the incident was caused by placing too much weight on the cross arm of the old pole and by inadequate procedures. Underlying factors were the decisions to leave the circuit energized and to limit personnel. September 13, 2008: The firm's workers were replacing two spans of power line. Two of the workers were working from a bucket truck when one of them (the acting subforeman) made inadvertent contact with an energized 14.4-kV power line. The current travelled through him and passed into the other worker. Both received first- and second-degree burns. WorkSafeBC concluded that the incident was caused by violating the limits of approach and contact with an energized conductor. Underlying factors included the lack of effective safety planning and inadequate supervision. December 23, 2009: Two of the firm's workers (cable splicers) were performing maintenance on a load-breaking switch in a manhole. When they contacted the energized conductor in the switch, an electrical arc flash occurred. Both workers were seriously injured, with one suffering severe burns. The workers had gone to the wrong manhole location and the switch at that location had not been de-energized. Underlying factors contributing to the incident were that the subforeman was given the wrong location on documents and that workers did not check information at the worksite against safety documents. Also, planning was inadequate. August 16, 2010: One of the firm's workers was terminating wires at an electrical substation. Not realizing the main conductor was energized, he received a fatal electrical shock. The investigation concluded that lack of verification, poor planning, and inadequate procedures contributed to the incident. In each of these four incidents, WorkSafeBC determined that the firm failed to provide its workers with the information, instruction, training, and supervision needed to ensure their safety.",https://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/create-manage/incident-investigations/penalties/penalty-summaries,canada,5_canada_cases.csv,97500.0,USD,
