The DPA's investigation found that inadequate security measures allowed the attack to occur. 

Interservere employees, for example, had not been adequately trained on data privacy. 

In addition, Interserve processed personal data on unsupported operating systems that were no longer subject to security updates to address vulnerabilities in the system. Also, Interserve had not conducted adequate vulnerability scans.

Of the 122 products in Easylife's Health Club catalog, 80 items were classified as 'trigger products.' Once customers purchased these products, Easlylife created a profile of them in order to target them with a health-related item.

The DPA found that this 'invisible' processing of the personal data constituted a serious violation of the data subjects' rights, as they were not able to exercise their privacy and data protection rights at all due to lack of knowledge of the processing.

For this, two emails were inadvertently sent with an open distribution list (one to 912 recipients and the second to 869 recipients).

It was clear from the content of the email that all recipients were patients of the clinic. The trust immediately recognized the error and unsuccessfully attempted to recall the emails. 

As part of its investigation, the IOC determined that the trust had no technical or organizational measures in place to prevent or mitigate this highly predictable human error. The ICO rated the harm to affected individuals as high given that information about the affected individuals' relationship with a gender identity clinic is very sensitive personal information.

Furthermore, in order to exercise their rights under the GDPR, such as the right of access under Art. 15 GDPR, data subjects had to provide Clearview with additional personal data by submitting a photograph of themselves that could be matched against the Clearview database.

In addition, the DPA found that the company had violated several principles of the GDPR. For example, the company had violated the principle of transparency by failing to adequately inform users about the processing of their data.

A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.

It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.

--> Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of £ 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.",link | https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/mpns/2618524/marriott-international-inc-mpn-20201030.pdf,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-60 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-60 ETid 60 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-60

The proposed fine relates to a cyber incident notified to the ICO by British Airways in September 2018. This incident in part involved user traffic to the British Airways website being diverted to a fraudulent site. Through this false site, customer details were harvested by the attackers. Personal data of approximately 500,000 customers were compromised in this incident, which is believed to have begun in June 2018. The ICO’s investigation has found that a variety of information was compromised by poor security arrangements at the company, including log in, payment card, and travel booking details as well name and address information.

In the meantime, the final fine imposed on the airline has been set at £20 million (approximately EUR 22,046,000). The ICO emphasized that when setting the amount of the fine, it also took into account the economic impact of the COVID-19 ('Coronavirus') pandemic on the airline industry.",link | https://ico.org.uk/action-weve-taken/enforcement/british-airways/,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-58 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-58 ETid 58 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-58
