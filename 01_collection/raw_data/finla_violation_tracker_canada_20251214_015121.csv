WorkSafeBC also observed a ladder that workers used to access work areas that placed them above erected guardrail sections. In addition, WorkSafeBC determined the firm's fall protection plan had only been verbally communicated to workers and did not include specific instructions on what fall protection system to use while accessing work areas. There was also no evidence that anyone in a supervisory role had checked on the workers to ensure the job task was being completed as planned. The firm failed to ensure fall protection was used, to have a written fall protection plan in place, and to ensure workers were instructed in the fall protection system to be used in their work area. The firm also failed to ensure floor openings were covered or guarded and identified, and to ensure there was a safe means of access and egress to each working level. Finally, the firm failed to provide its workers with the information, instruction, training, and supervision necessary to ensure their health and safety, a repeated violation.

February 20, 2006: The firm sent a four-person crew to replace an old utility pole. The circuit remained energized during the replacement. One worker was electrocuted and killed when two energized power lines touched his back. WorkSafeBC's investigation found that the incident was caused by placing too much weight on the cross arm of the old pole and by inadequate procedures. Underlying factors were the decisions to leave the circuit energized and to limit personnel. September 13, 2008: The firm's workers were replacing two spans of power line. Two of the workers were working from a bucket truck when one of them (the acting subforeman) made inadvertent contact with an energized 14.4-kV power line. The current travelled through him and passed into the other worker. Both received first- and second-degree burns. WorkSafeBC concluded that the incident was caused by violating the limits of approach and contact with an energized conductor. Underlying factors included the lack of effective safety planning and inadequate supervision. December 23, 2009: Two of the firm's workers (cable splicers) were performing maintenance on a load-breaking switch in a manhole. When they contacted the energized conductor in the switch, an electrical arc flash occurred. Both workers were seriously injured, with one suffering severe burns. The workers had gone to the wrong manhole location and the switch at that location had not been de-energized. Underlying factors contributing to the incident were that the subforeman was given the wrong location on documents and that workers did not check information at the worksite against safety documents. Also, planning was inadequate. August 16, 2010: One of the firm's workers was terminating wires at an electrical substation. Not realizing the main conductor was energized, he received a fatal electrical shock. The investigation concluded that lack of verification, poor planning, and inadequate procedures contributed to the incident. In each of these four incidents, WorkSafeBC determined that the firm failed to provide its workers with the information, instruction, training, and supervision needed to ensure their safety.",https://www.worksafebc.com/en/health-safety/create-manage/incident-investigations/penalties/penalty-summaries
