CNIL found that Amazon France equips its warehouse employees with a scanner to document certain tasks.


Each scan records data that is stored and can be used to calculate a series of indicators that provide information on the productivity of each employee.

The CNIL considered the establishment of a system that measures interruptions in activity with precision and potentially forces the employee to justify each break or interruption to be unlawful.


The CNIL also noted that the data collected by the system and the statistical indicators derived from it should be stored for 31 days. 

While the CNIL did not doubt that Amazon's intensive business needs and high performance objectives could justify the implementation of the scanner system for business management, it considered that the extensive storage of all these data was unlawful. Overall, however, it considered the extensive storage of all these data and statistical indicators to be disproportionate.

The CNIL also found a breach of the information and transparency obligation under the GDPR, as employees and external visitors were not adequately informed about the systems.

The hotel claimed it collected the CVC numbers of credit cards and even copies of personal identification document, when the booking was made via email, in order to prevent misuse of the credit cards.

Previously, to receive invoice by email the users only needed to provide their name, surname, address, personal identification number, facility number and their user number. 
 
During the investigation, it was found that Zagreb Holding lacked established rules for identifying service users requesting invoice copies via email and only collected copies of identification documents when there was suspicion of false representation. The company requested personal identification document copies from users whose email addresses had a different name/ structure than their name and surname, or if the user's name and surname in the email address did not match the requested invoice copy email address's structure. The DPA found that the mere inclusion of the correct name and surname in an email address is an insufficient protective measure. Consequently, the data controller failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures for user identification, contrary to Art. 25 (2) GDPR.

The controller is specialized in 'retargeting advertising'. This involves the company tracking the surfing behavior of Internet users via so-called Criteo trackers (cookies) in order to show them personalized advertising. 

In the course of its investigation, the DPA found numerous deficiencies in data processing. 

First, the DPA found that the controller failed to prove that Internet users had given their consent to be tracked using the Criteo trackers. Also, the controller failed to ensure that its partners obtained consent from the Internet users of whose data it was processing. 


The DPA further found that the controller's privacy policy was not complete, as it did not list all the purposes for which it was processing data. In addition, some of the purposes were not clearly defined. 


In addition, the controller failed to adequately respond to a data subject's requests for information regarding their personal data. 


The DPA also found that when data subjects requested withdrawal of their consent or deletion of their data, the controller merely ensured that users were no longer shown personalized advertising. However, the controller did not delete the personal data of the data subjects.

Finally, the DPA found that the agreement between the controller and a joint controller was incomplete. 

In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA considered the fact that a large number of individuals were affected as an aggravating factor.",link | https://www.cnil.fr/fr/publicite-personnalisee-criteo-sanctionne-dune-amende-de-40-millions-deuros,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1912 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-1912 ETid 1912 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1912

AZOP had received a complaint from a data subject, stating that the controller had obtained a copy of their bank card. 

During its investigation, AZOP found that the controller had collected personal data (including copies of bank cards) of data subjects without a valid legal basis. In 2022, players had the option to have their winnings paid out not only via their bank account but also via their Visa card. The controller collected copies of the bank cards with the intention of complying with requirements of the national Money Laundering Act. However, AZOP found that the collection of the copies was not necessary to comply with the requirements of the Money Laundering Act and that the processing of the data was therefore unlawful.

In this context, AZOP also found that the controller had not sufficiently informed the data subjects about the processing of their personal data, in particular, it was expressly stated that the data controller does not store bank card numbers and that the numbers are not accessible to the unauthorized persons. Accordingly, the information provided to the data subjects was missing information on the legal basis, purpose of collection and retention period of the personal data. 

The controller also failed to take sufficient technical and organizational measures to protect personal data relating to the establishment of payment processes via Visa bank cards, as well as for the storage of data contained in the controller's databases. 

As a result, in 2022 the controller collected copies of a total of 2078 bank cards, of which 655 copies were fully accessible. 

In assessing the fine amount, AZOP took into account as an aggravating factor that financial data is particularly sensitive data and the controller therefore should have taken special measures to protect it. 

As a mitigating circumstance, it was taken into account that the controller had announced that it would bring its processing procedures in line with the GDPR and had deleted all secured copies of the bank cards.",link | https://azop.hr/an-administrative-fine-of-380000-eur-imposed-to-the-sports-betting-company/,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1859 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-1859 ETid 1859 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1859

This is the highest fine imposed to date under the GDPR. In its decision, the DPC found that Meta had violated Art. 46 GDPR by continuing to transfer personal data to the U.S. after the Schrems II ruling of the CJEU. According to the Schrems II ruling, U.S. law does not provide a level of protection for personal data substantially equivalent to that provided by EU law and that the standard contractual clauses (SCCs) also do not provide sufficient protection. Meta based its data transfers on the SCCs and additional own safeguards. However, during its investigation, the DPC determined that these additional measures did not compensate for the inadequate protections provided by U.S. law. 

Following the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision to other concerned supervisory authorities pursuant to Art. 60 GDPR. In response, the DPC received objections from supervisory authorities, which led to a dispute resolution procedure before the European Data Protection Board (EDPB). In its decision, the EDPB asked the DPC to amend the proposed fine and adapt it to the seriousness of the data protection breach.

The DPC also ordered to cease any future transfer of personal data to the U.S., as well as to cease storage, within six months, of data already transferred to the U.S.

The fine is the highest ever imposed by AZOP.

Attached to the complaint was a USB stick containing personal data (name, date of birth, personal identification number) of 77,317 debtors. 

During its investigation, AZOP found that controller did not provide sufficient information about the processing of personal data in its privacy policy. Moreover, it failed to provide information about the legal basis for the refund of overpaid funds. The breach affected 132,652 individuals. 

Further, the AZOP found that the controller had not entered into a data processing agreement with a processor that monitored simple consumer bankruptcies. This put the data of 83,896 individuals at risk. The breach persisted for 2 years.

Finally, AZOP found that the controller had failed to implement adequate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data. 
Deficiencies in the controller's security system led to insecure processing of personal data on a large scale, resulting in the unauthorized filtering of data. AZOP noted that the breach has been ongoing since at least 2019 and has not been addressed to date. 

Aggravating factors considered by AZOP included the controller's failure to adequately cooperate with the DPA during the process. Furthermore, the controller has not yet informed AZOP of additional measures it has taken to prevent future risks of identified violations and has not yet brought its privacy policy into compliance with the GDPR.",link link | https://azop.hr/an-administrative-fine-in-the-amount-of-2-26-million-eur-imposed-to-the-debt-collection-agency/,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1816 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-1816 ETid 1816 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1816

EUR 5.5 million. The Austrian organization 'None of Your Business' (NOYB) had filed a complaint with the DPA on behalf of an individual. 

WhatsApp had updated its terms of service shortly before the GDPR came into force. In its new terms of service, WhatsApp informed its users to click 'Agree and Continue' to indicate their agreement with the new terms of service. This was required for further access to the services. WhatsApp assumed that the acceptance of the updated terms of use constituted a contract between WhatsApp and the user, since the processing of the data would be necessary for the provision as well as the improvement of the services. According to WhatsApp, the data processing was therefore lawful pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant argued that WhatsApp was actually trying to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing users' data. By making the access to its services conditional on users' consent to the updated terms of service, WhatsApp was forcing users to consent to the processing of their personal data. 

Following the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other European supervisory authorities concerned. The DPC found that WhatsApp did not rely on user consent as a legal basis, and did not consider 'coerced consent' in this case. It also did not rule out the possibility that WhatsApp relied on a contractual legal basis. In response, the DPC received objections from different supervisory authorities. However, the DPC found that WhatsApp had breached its transparency obligations under the GDPR, by not clearly explaining to users for what purpose and on what legal basis their personal data would be processed. 

As no agreement could be reached on the disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR. In its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by WhatsApp. However, the EDPB took a different position than the DPC on the issue of the legal basis and found that WhatsApp was not entitled to rely on a contractual legal basis. The EDPB therefore found that WhatsApp had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required WhatsApp to bring its data processing into compliance within three months.
The DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required WhatsApp to bring its data processing into compliance within six months.",link link | https://dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/data-protection-commission-announces-conclusion-inquiry-whatsapp,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1578 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-1578 ETid 1578 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1578

The DPA has imposed a fine of EUR 210 million for violations related to the provision of its Facebook service and EUR 180 million for violations related to the provision of its Instagram service. The Austrian organization 'None of Your Business' (NOYB) had filed a complaint with the DPA on behalf of two individuals. 

Meta had updated its terms of service shortly before the GDPR came into force. In its new terms of service, Meta informed its users to click 'Agree and Continue' to indicate their agreement with the new terms of service. This was required for further access to the services. Meta assumed that the acceptance of the updated terms of use constituted a contract between Meta and the user, since the processing of the data would be necessary for the provision as well as the improvement of the services. According to Meta, the data processing was therefore lawful pursuant to Art. 6 (1) b) GDPR. However, the complainant argued that Meta was actually trying to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing users' data. By making the access to its services conditional on users' consent to the updated terms of service, Meta was actually forcing users to consent to the processing of their personal data. 

Following the investigation, the DPC submitted a draft decision under Art. 60 GDPR to other European supervisory authorities concerned. The DPC found that Meta did not rely on user consent as a legal basis, and did not consider 'coerced consent' in this case. It also did not rule out the possibility that Meta relied on a contractual legal basis. In response, the DPC received objections from different supervisory authorities. However, the DPC found that Meta had breached its transparency obligations under the GDPR, by not clearly explaining to users for what purpose and on what legal basis their personal data would be processed. 

As no agreement could be reached on the disputed points, the DPC initiated a dispute resolution procedure pursuant to Art. 65 GDPR. In its decision, the EDPB confirmed the violation of transparency obligations by Meta. However, the EDPB took a different position than the DPC on the issue of the legal basis and found that Meta was not entitled to rely on a contractual legal basis. The EDPB therefore found that Meta had violated Art. 6 (1) GDPR. The DPC agreed in its final decision and imposed the fine and also required Meta to bring its data processing into compliance within three months.",link | https://dataprotection.ie/en/news-media/data-protection-commission-announces-conclusion-two-inquiries-meta-ireland,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1543 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-1543 ETid 1543 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1543

An individual had filed a complaint with the DPA because she had received an invitation from the regional health authority to participate in the cervical cancer screening program that was addressed to her daughter, who died in 1995.

During its investigation, the DPA discovered that the daughter's data was still in the region's database even though she had already died. 
For this reason, the DPA found that the Region had violated the principles of accuracy and correctness. 

As the owner of the data, the Region should have ensured that the personal information was accurate and updated as necessary, and taken all reasonable steps to delete or correct the information it used in a timely manner.

In addition to the above, the Garante also found that the Region had not properly provided data subjects with the required information about the processing of their personal data when sending out the invitation letters for a cervical cancer screening campaign.

Of the 122 products in Easylife's Health Club catalog, 80 items were classified as 'trigger products.' Once customers purchased these products, Easlylife created a profile of them in order to target them with a health-related item.

The DPA found that this 'invisible' processing of the personal data constituted a serious violation of the data subjects' rights, as they were not able to exercise their privacy and data protection rights at all due to lack of knowledge of the processing.

In spring and summer 2020, several security incidents occurred in the agency's systems, resulting in the loss of data records.

Both CNIL and other European DPAS had received complaints against ACCOR from several individuals. 

In the course of its investigation, CNIL found that hotel guests who made a booking directly with the hotel or on one of the hotel group's websites automatically became recipients of an advertising newsletter as the box for consent to receive the newsletter was pre-ticked. In addition, the CNIL found that due to technical problems, many individuals were unable to opt-out of receiving the promotional emails. 

In this context, CNIL found that ACCOR had not sufficiently informed data subjects about the processing of their personal data in the context of promotional messages and thus violated Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR. 

Further, ACCOR had failed to respond to data subjects' requests for access to personal data in a timely manner, and thus the CNIL found a violation of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 15 GDPR. 

The company had also failed to comply with the data subjects' right to object due to the technical problems. The CNIL therefore found a violation of Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 21 GDPR. 

Finally, the CNIL found a violation of Art. 32 GDPR because ACCOR allowed the use of passwords that were not sufficiently secure. 

In imposing the fine, CNIL considered aggravatingly that the violations affected several fundamental principles of personal data protection and constituted a fundamental infringement of the rights of the data subjects, as well as the number of data subjects involved.",link link | https://www.cnil.fr/fr/prospection-commerciale-et-droits-des-personnes-sanction-de-600-000-euros-lencontre-daccor,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1361 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-1361 ETid 1361 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-1361

Two data subjects had complained to the DPA that Google had disclosed their personal data to third parties without authorization. 

In the course of the lengthy investigation, the DPA found that Google had passed on personal data of data subjects to the so-called Lumen project. 

Lumen is a project run by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University. The project began in 2002 for the purpose of collecting requests relating to the removal of content from websites within and outside of the United States. This data may then be accessed by researchers and other interested parties. 

Users of Google-operated platforms such as YouTube or Google Drive have the option of requesting that content about themselves on the platforms be removed. For this purpose, Google has provided various contact and complaint forms.

However, the data of the data subjects who use these forms was automatically transmitted to the Lumen project. 
The data subjects did not have the opportunity to object to this transmission, because the automatic transmission to Lumen was a condition for using the forms. 
For this reason, the DPA found that, due to the lack of possibility to object to the transfer of the data to Lumen, Google processed the data subjects' data without a valid legal basis. 

In this context, the DPA also found that Google did not sufficiently enable data subjects to exercise their right to erasure of their data. 

When assessing the fine, the DPA took into account as aggravating factors that the data was not only disclosed, but also transferred to a third country without giving the data subjects the possibility to object to it. This deprived the data subjects of control over the handling of their personal data. In addition, the DPA found that the transfer took place over a very long period of time.

During its investigation, the CNIL found several violations of the GDPR.

Namely, DEDALUS had violated Art. 29 GDPR by extracting more data than required in the course of processing on behalf of two laboratories. 

In addition, the DPA found that DEDALUS had failed to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure the security of personal data. This constitutes a violation of Art. 32 GDPR.

For example, no specific procedure for data migration operations had been implemented. Also, the leaked data had not been stored in encrypted form on the server. In addition, the DPA found that DEDALUS lacked authentication for access to the public area of the server. 

The absence of such security measures was one of the main causes of the data leak. 

Further, the DPA found that the contractual documents between DEDALUS and its customers did not comply with the requirements set forth in Art. 28 GDPR.

This is the highest fine ever imposed by the Dutch DPA

As part of its investigation, the DPA found a number of violations of the GDPR. 

The Tax and Customs Administration had kept a list for several years on which it recorded indications of fraud. The list contained information on over 270,000 individuals, including minors. The administration had processed personal data such as health, citizenship, and criminal personal data as part of the list maintenance.

The DPA initially found that the administration did not have a valid legal basis for processing the data contained in the list. For this reason, the data were processed unlawfully. 

Further, the DPA found that the information in the list was often incorrect, so that a large number of individuals were falsely registered as possible fraudsters. 

In addition, the investigation revealed that the maintenance of the list led to discrimination against some individuals, as the risk of fraud was determined on the basis of the nationality and appearance of the data subjects, among other factors. For example, donations to mosques were considered a risk factor for fraud. 

Furthermore, the DPA found that the administration violated its obligation under the GDPR to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures that ensure adequate protection of the personal data it collects. Indeed, the administration had inadequately secured the personal data. 

The DPA also found that the administration had violated the principle of storage limitation by storing the data for a longer time contrary to the retention period established for the personal data in the list.

Furthermore, the DPA found that the processing of the data in the list had not been necessary for the administration to properly perform its tasks. The processing was therefore disproportionate. Also, the administration had not sufficiently defined the purposes underlying the processing and thus violated the principle of purpose limitation. 

The fine is composed as follows: 

EUR 1 million for a breach of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR and Art. 6 (1) GDPR;
EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) b) GDPR;
EUR 750,000 for a breach of Art. 5 (1) d) GDPR;

The DPA had received several complaints against IAB Europe since 2019. In the context of this complaint, the compliance of the 'Transparency & Consent Framework (TCF)' with the GDPR was mainly questioned. The TCF was developed by IAB to promote compliance with the GDPR by organizations using the OpenRTB protocol. 

The OpenRTB protocol is a protocol for 'real-time bidding,' which is the automated online auction of user profiles for the sale and purchase of advertising space on the Internet. When users visit a website that contains an ad space, technology companies, through an automated auction system, can bid in real time for that ad space to display personalized advertising. 

When users visit a website for the first time, an interface appears through which they can consent to the collection and sharing of their personal information or object to various types of processing. 

As part of the TCF, a consent management tool appears during this process. The tool allows the user to object to certain types of data processing. The TCF registers the user's preferences through the tool by generating a TC string and sends it to all partners participating in the OpenRTB system. Based on this TC string, user profiles are compiled, which are then passed on to advertisers. This makes it visible to them what kind of data processing the users have agreed to. 

Within the scope of its investigation against IAB, the DPA identified a number of violations of the GDPR.

It found that the TC strings already constituted personal data and therefore IAB was required to have a legal basis for processing these data. However, IAB was unable to demonstrate any such legal basis.

In addition, IAB did not properly inform users about the functioning of the TCF. For example, the information provided to users was too generic and vague to understand the scope of the data processing. 

Furthermore, IAB had not maintained a register of its processing activities, had not appointed a data protection officer, as well as had not conducted a data protection impact assessment.

Based on this data, a fairly precise localization is possible. A review by the DPA revealed that the company had not cleaned up the residual information or metadata in the uploaded photos. Consequently, the data could be entered into any map service and the exact location where the photo was taken could be determined.

Rather, several clicks were required to reject all cookies, in contrast to a single click to accept them.

From this, the CNIL concluded that users would accept the deposit of cookies out of convenience with more frequency.

In September 2020, the psychotherapy center reported an attack on its patient database to the DPA. An unauthorized third party had gained access to Vastaamo's medical database on at least two occasions, in December 2018 and March 2019. The attacker had also siphoned off data and left a ransom note on the servers. Due to insufficient logging, neither the exact date of the breach nor the network addresses used by the attacker could be identified.

The most likely cause of the medical database leak was an unprotected port on the database where the root user account of the database was not password protected. The patient database server was open to the Internet without firewall protection during the period between November 26, 2017, and March 13, 2019.

For this reason, the DPA determined that the personal data were not adequately protected against unauthorized and unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction, or damage, and that the controller had not implemented basic measures for the secure processing of personal data.

As part of its investigation, the DPA also determined that the controller must have known as early as March 2019 that data in the patient information system had been lost and could have been compromised by an external attacker. Vastaamo should have immediately reported the security breach to both the DPA and its patients. However, Vastaamo was significantly late in meeting this obligation.

Grindr is a location-based social networking app designed for gay, bi, trans and queer people.  In 2020, the Norwegian Consumer Protection Authority filed a complaint against Grindr with the Norwegian DPA, alleging that the portal had shared information about users' GPS location, IP address, cell phone advertising ID, age and gender with several third parties for marketing purposes. 

Under GDPR, consent is required for the sharing of this personal data. However, during its investigation, the DPA found that the consent collected by Grindr was not valid. 

Users had to accept the privacy policy in order to use the app, but were not explicitly asked whether they would consent to their data being shared with third parties for marketing purposes. In addition, the information about the disclosure of personal data was not clear or accessible enough for users. 


The DPA points out that this type of data may identify a Grindr user as a member of a sexual minority. Grindr users would sometimes want to use the app anonymously without, for example, giving their full name or uploading a photo of themselves. With the sexual orientation of the users, a special category of personal data, which is subject to a particularly high level of protection, was therefore also affected. 

The DPA therefore considers the infringement to be a particularly serious case that justifies a deterrent high fine. Business models based on behavior-based marketing are widespread in the digital economy, making it important that the fines for GDPR violations are deterrent. 

---UPDATE---

The Norwegian Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the DPA to issue the fine.",link link link | https://www.datatilsynet.no/contentassets/8ad827efefcb489ab1c7ba129609edb5/administrative-fine---grindr-llc.pdf,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-950 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-950 ETid 950 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-950

For this reason, the tax and customs administration should have deleted the data on dual nationality as early as January 2014. Nevertheless, as of May 2018, the dual citizenship data of a total of 1,4 million people were still registered in the systems of the tax and customs administration.

According to the company, they learned about the security breach from another cybersecurity service provider who informed them that the customer data of 110,302 CityBee users had been published on the website of the hacking forum RaidForums.com. This included data such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, personal identification numbers, driver's license numbers, type of payment card and the last four digits of the card number of the data subjects. 

The DPA's investigation revealed that the published data originated from an unsecured backup copy of a database. 

The DPA found that the data breach occurred due to the company's failure to comply with its obligation to implement technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk to data subjects. 

The company had, for example, failed to appoint a person with appropriate competence to be responsible for security and risk management.  It had also failed to ensure that accesses to database files were logged and evaluated. 
In addition, the company had stored the database unencrypted, so that a person with technical knowledge could have had full access to the data in the file after downloading it.

The CNIL then conducted investigations in several RATP bus centers. These led to confirmation of this practice in three RATP bus centers. The CNIL indicated that files for evaluating performance and promotion prospects should only contain data necessary for evaluating employees.In particular, it was sufficient to indicate the total number of days of absence without the need to go into detail and distinguish the days associated with the exercise of the right to strike. It found that the use of data on the number of days staff members were on strike was not necessary for these purposes, and that the RATP thus violated the principle of data minimization set forth in Article 5 (1) (c) GDPR. In addition, the DPA found that the RATP had excessively retained many of its employees' data. Indeed, the RATP kept files on the evaluation of staff members for more than three years after the promotion commission, although their retention was only required for 18 months after the holding of these commissions.

In 367 cases, the data included medical information of people who had requested, for example, wheelchair transportation or additional services because they were blind or deaf.

EUR 3,296,326 for illegal telemarketing. 
The DPA's decision followed a complex investigation launched after dozens of reports and complaints from people who claimed that they received unsolicited promotional calls and promotional SMS both from Sky Italia directly and through call centers of other companies. 
In this regard, the DPA found that the promotional calls were made without adequately informing the users (such as about the origin of the personal data transmitted to Sky Italia). Thus, data subjects would have had the opportunity to contact the company that collected the data and object to the processing.  Only after obtaining consent, Sky would then have been allowed to proceed with the commercial offers. 
Sky used lists of data it had acquired from other companies for these promotional purposes. Contrary to Sky Italia's view, the consent to the disclosure of data to third parties given by the data subjects to the companies from which Sky Italia had acquired the lists did not authorize Sky Italia to use the data for its own promotional purposes.
In addition, Sky failed to verify the list of individuals who had objected to being contacted for advertising purposes before making the advertising calls. As a result, several data subjects had received advertising calls despite their explicit objection. Further, the DPA found that Sky had failed to properly appoint the suppliers of the lists as data processors. 
In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into aggravating consideration that the violations involved 'systemic' conduct that was rooted in the company's operations as well as the fact that Sky should have acquired sufficient experience and competence to make fundamental decisions in compliance with data protection regulations due to its ongoing contacts with the authority and its long-standing presence in the market.","link link | https://www.garanteprivacy.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9706389,",https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-877 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-877 ETid 877 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-877

A student had filed a complaint with the DPA about possible GDPR violations related to the use of a monitoring system during written exams. In the context of the emergency situation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic, the university had equipped itself with the remote monitoring software Respondus provided by the American company Respondus Inc. to ensure the normal running of the exams, since it was not possible to take the exams live and in person as usual. The software was able to monitor the behavior of the students through video recordings and snapshots taken at random intervals. In addition, the exam was audio-visually recorded and a photograph was taken of each examinee at the beginning of the exam. At the end of the exam, the system processed the video, inserted warning signals regarding possible indications of incorrect behavior, and, among other things, assigned a so-called 'review priority' so that the examiner could subsequently assess whether an unauthorized act had been committed during the exam. In its investigation the DPA found that students were not properly informed of the processing of their personal data involved in the use of Respondus. For instance they were not informed that they would be audiovisually recorded and that the images would subsequently be processed. In addition, students were not provided with information regarding specific retention periods for personal data. Nor had they received sufficient information about the fact that their personal data would be transferred to the United States; instead, they were only informed in general terms that personal data would be processed both within and outside the territory of the European Union. Furthermore, the DPA found that the little information the students had received was presented in a fragmented and disorganized manner in various documents. The DPA considered this to be a violation of the principles of lawfulness, fairness and transparency. The DPA also found that the university had processed the personal data without a valid legal basis. Thus, consent to the processing of personal data was a prerequisite to participate in the exams in the first place. As an alternative to online exams, the option of an in-person exam was proposed. However, in the light of the  pandemic, this also meant an increased health risk. Students were also concerned that refusing to take the online exams would negatively impact their grades. Consequently, the DPA concluded that the students' consent could not be considered voluntary. Further, the DPA found that the university retained the data for 12 months, although this would not have been necessary for the purpose of ensuring that the exams were properly carried out. 
Eventually, the DPA found violations related to the transfer of data to Respondus. The processing agreement between the University and Respondus was based on the data protection agreement between the EU and the USA, known as the Privacy Shield, although it had been declared invalid by the Schrems II ruling of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). For this reason, the DPA found that the university transferred personal data to a third country, even though this transfer was not in compliance with the conditions set forth in Chapter V of the GDPR.",link | https://www.gpdp.it/web/guest/home/docweb/-/docweb-display/docweb/9703988,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-876 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-876 ETid 876 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-876

The draft primarily addresses the fact that Facebook has included details on data processing in its terms of service, thus relying on Art. 6 (1) b) rather than on consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR. 
Critics consider this a loophole used by Facebook to circumvent the stricter GDPR requirements of consent according to Art. 6 (1) a) GDPR.

However, the DPC emphasizes that the GDPR does not establish a hierarchy of legal bases that can be used to process personal data.

Yet, the DPC noted that Facebook failed to provide clear information about its legal basis for data processing and highlights that the information provided by Facebook is discontinuous and that users are referred to different documents and texts of the data policy and terms of service. 

The DPC concludes its draft that Facebook has thus violated Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR, Art. 12 (1) GDPR and Art. 13 (1) c) GDPR.

The draft decision will now be forwarded to other European data protection authorities allowing them to comment on it.",link | https://noyb.eu/sites/default/files/2021-10/IN%2018-5-5%20Draft%20Decision%20of%20the%20IE%20SA.pdf,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-875 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-875 ETid 875 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-875

A visitor to the residence filed a complaint with the DPA. He based this on an installed video surveillance system in the accommodation. The video surveillance system recorded, among other things, the corridor connecting the accommodation with the communal showers. Moreover, the footage was not only recorded but also displayed in real time on the monitors of the concierge staff, creating the risk that the images could also be inadvertently seen by visitors or suppliers. During the course of the investigation, the institution's administration justified the installation of the video surveillance system by citing the need to prevent theft and ensure the health of residents by preventing unauthorized access during the pandemic period. 

The DPA found that the institute thereby violated the principles of lawfulness, transparency and data minimization. The fact that, as claimed by the institute, the passage of the guests to the shower rooms was filmed only occasionally and for a short duration, and that the quality of the recordings was not 'perfectly clear,' does not resolve the unlawfulness of the recordings. Also, the DPA noted that some procedural precautions - such as scheduling time windows to turn off the cameras to allow guests to visit the shower rooms without being filmed, or temporarily ensuring the security of the locations through alternative measures, such as the use of security personnel - may allow the institute to pursue the purpose of the video surveillance in an equally effective manner and avoid unjustifiably restricting the freedoms of the data subjects.

Furthermore, the DPA found that the institute had not properly fulfilled its duty to inform. The institute had only provided the data subjects with detailed information about the video surveillance system on the bulletin board after the investigation had begun. However, this type of information is not suitable for visually impaired people.

Moreover, another error occurred, which allowed all authenticated employees to access the reports. About 21,000 reports were affected.

Through a report on the state-owned broadcasting company NRK, the Norwegian DPA became aware that Ferde AS was transferring information on passages in toll rings to a data processor in China. On this basis, the DPA initiated an investigation into whether Ferde has implemented routines and measures to ensure adequate information security for the information transferred to China.

As part of its operations, Ferde is responsible for registering passages at toll booths. The registration is usually done by a chip in the car. If the chip in the car is not properly registered or the car does not have a chip, a photo of the car's license plate is taken.

These images are then sent to an automatic optical character recognition system to digitally read the license plate. In cases where the image quality is not good enough for automatic interpretation, the image is transmitted for manual processing. Ferde contracted Unitel Bratseth Services (UBS), which also has employees in China, for this task. 

After its investigations, the DPA concluded that Ferde AS had violated a number of basic obligations of the GDPR for a period of 1-2 years. 

For one thing, Ferde had not conducted a risk assessment before processing personal data and before using manual image processing by the processor. However, this would have been necessary to assess the risks associated with the transfer and to determine whether further security measures may be required. 

In addition, the DPA found that Ferde had not entered into a proper processor contract regarding the processing of UBS.As a result, the transfer of the personal data in question to China took place without a valid legal basis. 
In determining the amount of the fine, the DPA took into account the aggravating factor that a large amount of personal data was affected by the violation. On the other hand, the fact that no material or immaterial damage to the affected parties could be proven had a mitigating effect.",link | https://www.datatilsynet.no/contentassets/7121f4f2de614186bc535823c9da7102/20_01727-3vedtak-om-overtredelsesgebyr---ferde-as.pdf,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-851 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-851 ETid 851 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-851

The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPB), by its decision of July 28, 2021, then, required the DPC to reassess and increase its proposed fine based on a number of factors. The EDPS found a violation of the principle of transparency set forth in Article 5(1) a) of the GDPR in addition to the violations found by the DPC, and requested this to be reflected in the final amount of the fine. 

Based on this, the DPC imposed the fine in the amount of EUR 225,000,000. 

The fine is composed as follows:

EUR 90,000,000 for the violation of Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 12 GDPR;
EUR 30,000,000 for the violation of Art. 13 GDPR; and
EUR 75,000,000 for the violation of Art. 14 GDPR.


With respect to Art. 12 GDPR and Art. 13 GDPR, the DPC found that WhatsApp had failed to provide information about the nature of the data collection 'in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.' This includes making the information easy for children to understand when it is addressed to them. For example, WhatsApp had distributed information about the relationship between WhatsApp and other Facebook companies and the sharing of data under that relationship through a variety of texts. Much of the information provided was of such general nature, moreover, that the DPC deemed it meaningless. Users often had to overcome multiple links to FAQs to get to the information they were looking for on WhatsApp's website. In this regard, the DPC stated that it would be unreasonable to expect users to search the WhatsApp website after failing to find sufficient information in the privacy statement itself.

With regard to Art. 14 GDPR, one of the issues was the impact of a user's consent allowing the messaging platform to have access to his or her contacts. As such, the company searched its users' contact information on their phones for phone numbers and other data, not only from other WhatsApp users, but also from contacts who do not even have a WhatsApp account. The DPC finds that this data had been processed unlawfully, as these contacts (especially those who do not have a WhatsApp account) had not received any information about this processing and therefore could not possibly have given their consent. 

Given the seriousness and the far-reaching nature and impact of the breaches, the DPA concluded that there had also been a violation of the transparency principle from Art. 5 (1) a) GDPR.",link link | https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-09/dpc_final_decision_redacted_for_issue_to_edpb_01-09-21_en.pdf,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-820 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-820 ETid 820 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-820

However, the controller had designed the registration for the jö Bonus Club in such a way that the clarification about profiling could only be found after scrolling down.

The violations included a lack of transparency in the algorithms used to manage drivers, both when assigning jobs and when booking work shifts.
Deliveroo had used a centralized system for driver management through which it then processed and managed the assignment of orders as well as the booking of work shifts.
However, Garante notes that the controller did not adequately inform the drivers about the functioning of the system they had installed on their smartphones, and did not ensure the accuracy and correctness of the results of the algorithmic systems used to evaluate the drivers. 
In addition, Garante found that Deliveroo carried out a meticulous control of the drivers' work performance - through the continuous geolocation of their device, which went far beyond what was necessary to assign the order (e.g., recording the position every 12 seconds) - and through the storage of a large amount of personal data collected during the execution of the orders, including communication with customer service. In this context, the storage period of the various data had not been defined in a manner appropriate to the purpose. Instead, the controller had defined a flat storage period of six years. Furthermore, the Garante found that the controller had not implemented adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure adequate security of the processing.

At the same time, the CNIL received seven complaints from data subjects affected by this file.

For each of these individuals, the file contained information such as the organization they belonged to, the position they held, their business address, their business phone number, their cell phone number, their business email address, and in some cases their Twitter account. In addition, CNIL noted that each person was assigned a score from 1 to 5 to evaluate their influence, credibility, and support for Monsanto on various issues.

The DPA believes that the company violated the provisions of the GDPR by not informing the data subjects that their data was stored in this file. In addition, the CNIL complained that the company had not given the contractual guarantees that should normally regulate the relationship with a subcontractor. 

The creation of contact files by stakeholders for lobbying purposes is not illegal in itself. However, CNIL stressed that data subjects nevertheless have the right to be informed of the existence of the file in order to exercise additional rights, in particular the right to object.

A former employee of the municipality filed a complaint with the DPA against the municipality. 
In particular, the former employee complained that the municipality processed personal data related to his internet use during working hours and that he later received a notice of initiation of disciplinary proceedings accusing him of accessing Facebook for more than 40 minutes and YouTube for more than 3 hours during his working hours and of using the municipality's computer for private purposes.  The DPA's investigation revealed that the municipality had been using a system to control and filter employees' internet browsing for about a decade, with monthly retention of data and creation of special reports for network security purposes. The system also collected information that had nothing to do with professional activities and, in any case, concerned the private life of the person in question.
The DPA finds that the controller thus violated the principle of data minimization, lawfulness and purpose limitation. The controller should rather have taken less intrusive measures to prevent the private use of the Internet. The DPA pointed out that the need to reduce the risk of misuse of Internet navigation cannot lead to the complete elimination of any privacy of the data subject at the workplace, even in cases where the employee uses network services provided by the employer. In addition, the controller had not adequately informed employees about the collection of Internet history, in violation of its obligation under Article 13 of the GDPR. 
Furthermore, the investigation identified other violations in the processing of data related to employees' requests for extraordinary medical examinations, which were made using a special form.

The incident consisted of a security breach which led to unauthorized access and processing of personal data by hackers and involved personal data of 28,085 respondents. The incident occurred because the IT provider had not taken the necessary measures to achieve an adequate level of security in accordance with existing and foreseeable risks. The IT provider, as a data processor, was obliged to take appropriate technical security measures in such a way as to ensure the permanent confidentiality of the system, including regular testing, evaluation and assessment of the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures to ensure security of processing. When assessing the appropriate level of security, the IT provider should have taken particular account of the risks of unauthorized disclosure of personal data. Due to failure to take appropriate technical measures for the security of personal data processing, the DPA imposed an administrative fine on the IT provider.

Thus, when the sports equipment rental agreement was signed, consent to the processing of the ID copy was obtained at the same time.

These recordings could be viewed via a live video stream on Youtube and on the controller's homepage. In addition, the recordings could be rewound for up to twelve hours. 

The area covered by the camera surveillance included a public street, the parking lot and entrance of two grocery stores, a pharmacy, a liquor store, the local bank, city hall, and a number of other buildings.

It was not possible to make out facial details or read license plates on cars due to the image quality and distance from the camera. Nevertheless, the image quality was good enough to be able to identify what type of car the data subjects were driving, what type of clothing they were wearing, what hair color they had, and other personal characteristics. This was sufficient for those watching the live broadcast to identify and track co-workers, colleagues, friends, family, or other acquaintances.

The Norwegian DPA concluded that the live broadcast constitutes a breach of Art. 6 (1) GDPR and Art. 5 (1) a) GPDR.

The decision highlights that the illegal camera surveillance involved a significant number of employees and that many were monitored repeatedly, some on a daily basis. Those who were monitored were on their way to and from work, who needed to buy groceries, medications, or alcohol, or who were in the public area for other reasons.

Furthermore, the controller had violated the principle of data minimization by initiating checks on reimbursements even for individuals whose applications had been rejected and who had therefore never received payments.

Furthermore, the controller had not adequately assessed the risks associated with a data processing operation as sensitive as that on applications for social benefits, since it had not carried out an impact assessment on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

Between June 2018 and January 2020, the CNIL received several notifications of personal data breaches related to a website where several million customers regularly shop. In response, the CNIL decided to investigate the company and its subcontractor entrusted with the management of this website.

In the course of its investigations, the CNIL found that the website in question had been subjected to numerous waves of credential stuffing attacks. In this type of attack, a malicious person obtains lists of 'unencrypted' identifiers and passwords published on the Internet, usually after a data breach. Assuming that users frequently use the same password and username (email address) for different services, the attacker will use 'bots' to try to log in to a large number of websites.

The CNIL considers that the two companies had breached their obligation to maintain the security of customers' personal data under Article 32 of the GDR.

At the same time, the data subjects were not given the option of specifically not consenting to this transfer. Instead, if they wished to disagree with the transfer of their data, they were required to send a letter of disagreement to each individual company in the group.

The DPA concluded that the bank had violated its information obligations as set out in Art. 13 GDPR and Art. 14 GDPR, as the information provided to customers under the privacy policy was not consistent, contained imprecise terminology, and did not provide sufficient information on the type of personal data processed and the nature of the processing.  Also, the information on the rights of the data subjects as well as the contact information of the controller were not provided in a consistent manner. 

Furthermore, the DPA notes that the controller had processed its customers' data beyond its legitimate interests, partly without a legal basis, and that the consent it obtained from customers did not meet the requirements of an effective consent. In addition, deficiencies in the company's procedures allowed it to obtain the consent of customers to process their personal data. The DPA further concludes that, as a result, the data was unlawfully transferred to the companies of the CaixaBank Group. This constitutes a violation of Art. 6 GDPR.

Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten also objected to Google's current practice of informing web site owners about which results Google is removing from search results, specifically which link has been removed and who is behind the request for removal from the list, as this is without legal basis.

A caller could obtain extensive information on personal customer data from the company's customer service department simply by entering a customer's name and date of birth. In this authentication procedure, the BfDI aws a violation of Article 32 GDPR, according to which a company is obliged to take appropriate technical and organisational measures to systematically protect the processing of personal data. Due to the company's cooperation with the data protection authority, the fine imposed was at the lower end of the scale. -- Update: On November 11th, 2020, after an appeal against the fine, the Bonn District Court decided that although the fine is justified in principle, it is unreasonably high. The chamber has therefore reduced the fine from originally EUR 9,55 million to EUR 900,000. One of the reasons for the reduction was that the company's procedure for authenticating customers used for its telephone hotline (requesting only the name and date of birth of the caller) had remained unobjected for a long time and therefore the company lacked a concrete awareness of the problem which leads to the fact that the concrete culpability in this case had to be classified as rather low. Furthermore, according to the court, the violation was also rather minor, as it could not lead to a massive data leakage.",link | https://www.bfdi.bund.de/DE/Infothek/Pressemitteilungen/2019/30_BfDIverh%C3%A4ngtGeldbu%C3%9Fe1u1.html,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-128 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-128 ETid 128 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-128

According to the data protection authority, personal data of tenants were stored without checking whether storage was permissible or even necessary and it was therefore possible to access personal data of affected tenants which had been stored for years without this data still serving the purpose of its original collection. This involved data on the personal and financial circumstances of tenants, such as salary statements, self-disclosure forms, extracts from employment and training contracts, tax, social security and health insurance data as well as bank statements. In addition to sanctioning this structural violation, the Berlin data protection commissioner imposed further fines of between 6,000 and 17,000 euros on the company for the inadmissible storage of personal data of tenants in 15 specific individual cases. See the separate entry. *** UPDATE *** On 24 February 2021 the Berlin Regional Court has dismissed the fine against Deutsche Wohnen SE due to procedural errors, see link and link. This was based on the fact that, according to German law, a fine can only be issued to a company if the offence is attributable to a natural person, such as a managing director or employee. The case was then appealed to the Appellate Court of Berlin, which on 16 December 2022 in turn referred it to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary decision on whether the Regional Court's decision aligned with European law. On 5 December 2023 the European Court of Justice ruled that while culpability is indeed required for a fine to be issued, it is not always necessary to attribute the offence to a natural person. If the controller is a company instead of a natural person, it shall suffice if the offence is attributable to the company itself. In light of this decision the Appellate Court of Berlin overturned the initial decision of the Regional Court of Berlin and referred the case back to the Regional Court of Berlin for a new decision which, at the time of the editorial deadline of this update, is still pending, see link | https://rsw.beck.de/aktuell/daily/meldung/detail/kg-streit-um-millionen-bussgeld-gegen-deutsche-wohnen#:~:text=Die%20Beh%C3%B6rde%20wirft%20der%20Deutsche,von%2014%2C5%20Millionen%20Euro.",link | https://www.datenschutz-berlin.de/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/pressemitteilungen/2019/20191105-PM-Bussgeld_DW.pdf,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-98 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-98 ETid 98 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-98

A variety of personal data contained in approximately 339 million guest records globally were exposed by the incident, of which around 30 million related to residents of 31 countries in the European Economic Area (EEA). Seven million related to UK residents.

It is believed the vulnerability began when the systems of the Starwood hotels group were compromised in 2014. Marriott subsequently acquired Starwood in 2016, but the exposure of customer information was not discovered until 2018. The ICO’s investigation found that Marriott failed to undertake sufficient due diligence when it bought Starwood and should also have done more to secure its systems.

--> Update: On 2020/10/30, the ICO announced its final decision to impose a fine of £ 18.4 million (approximately EUR 20.4 million) on Marriott International Inc. In its decision, the ICO set forth its considerations for the calculation of the fine, which included Marriott's absence of prior violations or omissions and the fact that Marriott had fully cooperated with the investigation and had taken steps to notify the individuals concerned. In addition, the ICO noted that it had also made an alignment with other fines already imposed on other companies - in particular also of other European data protection authorities.",link | https://ico.org.uk/media/action-weve-taken/mpns/2618524/marriott-international-inc-mpn-20201030.pdf,https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-60 (Copy: ) | Short URL: https://etid.link/ETid-60 ETid 60 | https://www.enforcementtracker.com/ETid-60

As mandated by law, the fine was based on 4% of the party's annual turnover and 2.65 % of its anticipated turnover for the coming year.

The breach was the result of a cyber attack by an anonymous hacker who accessed and disclosed information on the vulnerability of the organisation’s system – a database of more than 6,000 individuals – and the command used for the attack. The system was vulnerable to attack because of a redirection problem with the organisation's webpage.

Additionally, the company had not established and documented deadlines for deletion of personal data in their new CRM system. The deadlines set for the old system were not deleted after the deadline for the information had been reached. Also, the controller had not adequately documented its personal data deletion procedures. 

Please note: Since Danish law does not provide for administrative fines as in the GDPR (unless it is an uncomplicated case and the accused person consented), fines will be imposed by courts. 

Update: On February 12, 2021 the Aarhus District Court decided to impose a fine against IDdesign in the amount of EUR 13,450. With regard to the calculation of the fine, the court disagreed with the proposed amount of the fine. It concluded that the amount should be calculated on the basis of the company's own turnover and not that of the entire group. In addition, the court considered that the mitigating circumstances under Art. 83 (2) GDPR should be taken into account when calculating the fine.
